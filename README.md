This is my resume.  There are many like it, this one is mine.

Anyway, if you want to do a resume in TeX, here's one way.

I did a resume a long time ago in whatever word processor I had on hand,
starting over as I upgraded computers and word processors.  The final version
was always external-edit-resistant PDF, which I kept handy, but then I would
misplace the original version.  When it came time to look for the next job, I'd
have to start over.  Finally I picked up on the pattern and just changed it to
LaTeX, and it's GitHub-friendly.

Plus, I like the look, and the secret handshake, of a resume in Computer
Modern.

I stole tscv.sty, as attributed in its comments.  It works for me.  I can't
remember if I edited it.  I got it from here: http://www.sudo.ws/todd/resume.html

Finally, if you're poking around GitHub repositories, please note that I'm not
continually looking for a job.  I just have source code laying around that I
want to make world-readable.
