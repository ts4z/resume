This is my resume.  There are many like it, this one is mine.

Anyway, if you want to do a resume in TeX, here's one way.

I retyped my resume a couple times using whatever word processor I had on hand,
producing external-edit-resistant PDF from whatever format was convenient.
Then I would misplace the original version.  This annoyed me, and when I next
edited it, I went for the ultimate final reformat.  Now there are just the
edits.

I like the look, and the secret handshake, of a resume in Computer Modern.

I stole tscv.sty, as attributed in its comments.  It works for me.  I can't
remember if I edited it.  I got it from here: http://www.sudo.ws/todd/resume.html

Finally, if you're poking around GitHub repositories, please note that I'm not
continually looking for a job.  I just have source code laying around that I
want to make world-readable.
