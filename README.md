This is my resume.  There are many like it, this one is mine.

Anyway, if you want to do a resume in TeX, here's one way.

The last time I went looking for work, I spent time fighting with re-typing my
resume because I lost the old version, going from one word processor to
another.  This annoyed me, and when I next edited it, I went for the ultimate
final reformat.

I like the look, and the secret handshake, of a resume in TeX.  (Or in this
case LaTeX, because I learned my lesson about raw TeX a while ago.)

I stole tscv.sty, as attributed in its comments.  It works for me.  I can't
remember if I edited it.  I got it from here: http://www.sudo.ws/todd/resume.html

Finally, if you're poking around github repositories, please note that I'm not
actually looking for a job.  I just have source code laying around that I want
to make world-readable.
